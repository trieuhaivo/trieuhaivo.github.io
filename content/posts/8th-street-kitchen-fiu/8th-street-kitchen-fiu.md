Today I went to the 8th Street Kitchen at FIU for the first time. It‚Äôs a buffet-style restaurant that offers a wide variety of food. The experience was great‚Äîthere were plenty of options like vegetables, fruits, ice cream, rice with chicken or pork, pasta, and drinks. I tried a bit of everything and especially enjoyed the rice dishes, pasta, vegetables, and ice cream.

The best part is the price: only `$13`, which is much cheaper than most restaurants around FIU, where a single dish usually costs about `$20` plus tax. For me, as a student, `$13` is definitely affordable. It‚Äôs a nice option to switch things up once in a while alongside the meals I usually cook at home. Overall, it was a really good experience!
